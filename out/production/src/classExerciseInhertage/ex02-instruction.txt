Exercise Two

In this programme, we would like to interact with three types of vehicles, horse, car and truck.
Firstly, we would like to display the weight/mass (units in kg) and the speed (units in m/s) of the three vehicles.
Then, we would like to calculate the maximum momentum that each vehicle can have.
The formula for calculate momentum is " momentum = mass * speed ".
After we calculate the maximum momentum of each vehicle, the programme should print the largest value among all vehicles.
Lastly, some vehicles can be filled up by fuels. The programme will examine through all vehicles and  fill up the vehicles that can take fuels.

1)  Please examine all the classes in the ex02 folder carefully to understand the classes.
    For this exercise, you only need to modify this VehicleManager class.
2)  Please follow the steps 1 - 4 inside the VehicleManager class (TODO 1. - 4.) to achieve the desired outcome.
